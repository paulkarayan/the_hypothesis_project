[00:58:46] JM: All right. If you are not working on RedwoodJS – By the way, I know you work on
a lot of different projects at the same time, but if you are not focused on Redwood, what would
you be working on? Do you have any other ideas brewing just in your head or things that you've
started to tinker on?

[00:59:02] TPW: Sure! I have plenty of ideas. One thing that we do currently – I mean, I can
answer this as there are other things that I'm doing. I mean, I'm running another startup called
Chatterbug. That’s for foreign language learning. Check that out. Chatterbug.com. I'm doing
that. I'm also running and helping to run with my wife what we call Preston-Warner Ventures,
which is our sort of investment firm, if you will. We do angel investments. We do a lot of
nonprofit grants around family-planning and women's health around the world internationally.
We also have a program that's part of Preston-Warner Ventures called Hypothesis, which is a
place where we fund projects that we wish existed, but don't necessarily have enough time
ourselves to work on.

Redwood is actually one of these hypothesis projects, even though I actually do work on it, but I
have hired several other people to work on it with me. So we have a core team of four people,
three of which essentially are working full-time and then I act mainly as sort of project manager
around it, but then do coding when I have time, of which during COVID-19 times –I have three
kids, and so I have no time. But I mean, there're lots of ideas. I have ideas for a VR space
racing game. I want to fund the creation of a book or an online tool/visualization thing/written
material around learning quantum physics if you only have an algebra background. What does it
actually take to understand the mathematics of quantum physics? Take me there. All I know is
algebra. Teach me only the method I need to know in order to fully grok the mathematics behind
quantum physics. I've never seen that. That's something that I want to fund.
I would love to also work on – This is the way that I work on things these days, right? When you
have limited time, the ability to invest in things, then the way that you work on things is by
helping other people work on them. Another thing I would love is more of an official work on
homelessness in San Francisco, like why is that such a persistent problem? What are the
drivers? Where is the money going in San Francisco? We put a lot of money into this problem
and we don't see a lot of solutions out the other end. So just help me erase my ignorance. I
would love to fund that.

But I’m stretched pretty thin right now. I mean, I'm getting into climate change action as well.
We’ll be funding some efforts around climate change. So I've been doing a lot of reading around
that. I love the technology of the energy industry. How can we do better? How do we build out a
grid can support wind and solar as a bigger part of our energy production? Will I get into the
energy industry someday? Not impossible. It’s in my mind.
