# The Hypothesis Project

If you spend most of your time building things, you've probably appreciate that solving the **right** problem matters an awful lot.

You probably also see a bunch of places where a nice tool would really help out - and maybe you don't have the time and/or expertise needed to make it happen yourself. Or maybe, you're like me and looking for some places to use your skills to make the world a better plan (tm).

Inspired by Tom Preston-Werner (see below), here is a collection of "Hypothesis lists" - projects that we wish existed, but don't necessarily have enough time
ourselves to work on.

We encourage you to submit a list - ideally in the form of a link to markdown, google doc, &c. &c - and (optionally) a brief biography if you're interested in people chatting to you. The more you can explain about **why** this is a good project or a worth problem to solve, the better.

Thank you!
