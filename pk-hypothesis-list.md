### Guaranteed "Working Examples" of Software Projects

I am one of those people who learns by playing with new software packages and ideas, with the goal of understanding if (and how) this will be valuable.

it's often easier for me to ascertain this by tweaking something that's already working. i find this higher value than working through docs or a blog post - often times these don't work.

i haven't found an authoritative set of Working Examples - nor have I found any that provide some guarantee of the project actually working - which could be in the form of "Living Documentation" with BDD or some other form of testing.

finally - could we use Docker or Kubernetes to ensure that the project works for anyone, out of the box? that would eliminate issues of conflicting packages etc... that plague a lot of projects.

### Component-based Development

#### Write Once, Work Anywhere

see RPC below
Write your business logic in any language, wrap it in light middleware.
get it as a cloud function, a library, a slack function, flask service, CLI, etc...
where appropriate.

#### RPC-like Approach to Software Composition

e.g. progressive transpiling?

#### Semantic Search for Software Capabilities and/or Components

see "Specialized Search & Knowledge Graphs" below

#### Backend Component Libraries

### Operational Development Environment

### BDD and "Description as a Service"

### Split Testing Backend Components

Gloo
Scientist

### Rapid Commercialization - The Next Ruby-on-Rails

### System / SLA Overviews That Work

### Specialized Search / Knowledge Graphs

### Find Python packages that interest me aka Irregularium

### Prototyping Tools that Don't Suck

#### Spreadsheet -> Python Script

### Systems Composition & Production at the Right Abstraction Level

#### Mechatronics / Software Composition - the right abstraction level for this, at least

#### Mechatronics Components Design -> Assembly
