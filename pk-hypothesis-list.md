# [WIP] PK's Hypothesis List

### Semantic Search for Software Capabilities

### Guaranteed "Working Examples" of Software Projects

### Write Once, Work Anywhere

see RPC below
Write your business logic in any language, wrap it in light middleware.
get it as a cloud function, a library, a slack function, flask service, CLI, etc...
where appropriate.

### (backend) Component Libraries

### RPC-like Approach to Software Composition

e.g. progressive transpiling?

### Rapid Commercialization - The Next Ruby-on-Rails

### System / SLA Overviews That Work

### Specialized Search / Knowledge Graphs

### BDD

### Prototyping Tools that Don't Suck

### Split Testing Backend Components

### Spreadsheet -> Python Script

### Mechatronics / Software Composition - the right abstraction level for this, at least

### Mechatronics Components Design -> Assembly
